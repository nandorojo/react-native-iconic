# React Native Iconic

- ðŸ˜Ž Free, beautiful icons
- ðŸ”¥ Customizable with `react-native-svg` props
- ðŸŒ² Tree-shaken components
- ðŸ¤– TypeScript support
- ðŸ“ˆ JS-only (+ works with Expo)

```ts
import { AnnotationDots } from '@nandorojo/iconic'

export function Icon() {
  return <AnnotationDots />
}
```

[Iconic](https://iconic.app/) is an awesome icon set made by [@jamesm
](https://twitter.com/jamesm) and [@ormanclark](https://twitter.com/@ormanclark).

Iconic has 200+ free icons and a premium plan. This repo exports React Native components for each of its free icons.

## Example

See the example snack:

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @nandorojo/iconic react-native-svg
```

## Usage

Each icon is exported as its own component with an adjusted name.

For example, to use the `arrow-down` icon, import `ArrowDown`:

```tsx
import { ArrowDown } from '@nandorojo/iconic'
```

You can also `import * as Iconic`:

```tsx
import * as Iconic from '@nandorojo/iconic'

export const Icon = () => <Iconic.ArrowDown />
```

For a full directory of components, see the [Iconic](https://iconic.app/c/availability/free) website.

### Custom color

```tsx
<ArrowUp color="black" />
```

### Custom size

```tsx
<ArrowUp height={30} width={30} />
```

## Props

Each icon component accepts all the props from `react-native-svg`'s `Svg` component. Reference their docs.

## How it works

This library uses `react-native-svg`. The components are generated by `svgr`. I downloaded all the free icons from [ionic.app](https://ionic.app) and [ran a script](/generate/index.ts) to codegen the files from there.
